        <h3>Why Martial Arts?</h3>
        <p>Simply put, Martial Arts training will build physical strength and st
            rength of character. Martial Arts are for everyone, regardless of ag
            e or body type. And since it encourages a lifestyle of total well-be
            ing, Martial Arts training is a lifelong journey rather than a desti
            nation.</p>

        <h3>Why Our School?</h3>
        <p>We could say we’re the best in the area because we offer so much more
            than other schools. But we’ll let you make that decision! From our f
            riendly, knowledgeable and well-trained staff to our clean, safe and
            well-equipped facility, we have the perfect program for YOU. We’re k
            id-focused and adult-savvy. We’ll not only teach you all the techniq
            ues and moves, but we’ll also educate you in the Martial Arts way: R
            espect, Self-Confidence and Discipline.</p><br /> 
        <p><strong>Parents:</strong> We guarantee to transform your child into a motivated, self-
            starter who will clean his/her room without being asked! So come grow 
            with us… and bring the entire family! Our leadership program is wh
            y many teachers and doctors send students to us.</p><br />

        <p>The history of our school is known as the first in the industry to in
            corporate various levels of Leadership to progress through the curri
            culum. We develop students into not just good kickers but well-round
            ed individuals. Athletes improve their capabilities well beyond expe
            ctations. Shy children are transformed into strong individuals that 
            don’t follow the crowd. Aggressive or hyper children learn to channe
            l the energy. Dr. Steve Reel (formerly of Ben Lippen Private Schools
            Assistant Headmaster) said; “My whole family loved your program espe
            cially because you conducted classes the whole family can adjust to 
            and the Leadership Levels and challenges are priceless in an ever ch
            allenging world.”</p><br />

        <p>The history of our style is rooted in Shotokan which was developed by
            the great Gichin Funakoshi.</p><br />
